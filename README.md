#A Udacity FEND project.

This is an implementation of Frogger game where user has to go through a lane avoiding the beetles. They score a point once they cross the lane without getting hit. With increasing score, the number of beetles increases.

#Running

Visit https://github.com/mykalmorton/Arcade-Game OR open index.html in browser (after cloning).

Use the arrow keys to move the character. Your goal is to make him reach the water side (on the top) without getting hit from any of the beetles. When the player reaches the water side the game will end.

###Playing the Game

The goal of this game is to get your character to the water. Sounds simple, right? Well, it's not quite that easy... You see, there are bugs moving at varying speeds on the paved-block portion of the scene. If you collide with a bug, your character will be moved back to the original starting position and your score will be reduced. On the other hand, each time you make it to the water safely your score will be increased generously. But, immediately after the short celebration a new bug will be spawned in order to make your next trip to the water a bit more challenging. Let's see how high of a score you can get, shall we?

#Controls:

If you're playing the game on a computer with a keyboard, you can move your character by using the UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. These are the only keys you need to worry about for playing this game.
